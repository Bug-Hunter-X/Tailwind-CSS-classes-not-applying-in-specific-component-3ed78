# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in Specific Component

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly within a specific component, despite seemingly valid syntax and configuration.  The issue is particularly challenging to debug because the classes work fine elsewhere in the application.

## Bug Description:

The problem is that certain Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied to a specific React component, although the same classes are applied correctly in other parts of the app. There are no apparent syntax errors, and the Tailwind CSS configuration appears to be correctly set up.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe that the problematic component does not render with the expected Tailwind classes.

## Solution:

The solution addresses the issue by [describing the solution briefly, e.g., adding a specific CSS override, refactoring the component structure, or updating Tailwind configuration].  See `bugSolution.js` for a working implementation.
